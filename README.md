# Movie-Searching Website

A movie exploration and tracking web application built with **React.js**. This app allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and manage a list of movies they have watched. The project fetches data from the OMDB API and stores the watched movies locally.

## Features

- **Search for Movies**: Find movies by title, and view their details such as genre, cast, and ratings.
- **Watched Movies List**: Users can add and remove movies from their personal "watched" list.
- **Rate the Movies**: Users can rate movies they have watched and store these ratings locally.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop devices, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Local Storage**: The watched movies list is saved locally, so your progress is retained even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: To build the user interface using reusable components.
- **OMDB API**: To fetch movie data such as details, ratings, cast, and more.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the main logic and functionality of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive.
